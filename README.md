# Password-Generator-Project

Project Name: Random Password Generator using JS
Description:

The "Random Password Generator using JS" is a web application designed to create strong and secure passwords for users. This project leverages JavaScript to generate random passwords based on user-selected criteria. The application features four checkboxes that allow users to customize their passwords by including or excluding specific types of characters:

Uppercase Letters: Users can opt to include uppercase alphabetic characters (A-Z) in their passwords.
Lowercase Letters: Users can choose to incorporate lowercase alphabetic characters (a-z).
Numbers: This option allows the inclusion of numeric digits (0-9) in the generated password.
Special Characters: Users can include special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, &, etc.) for added complexity.
In addition to these customization options, the application includes a color-coded strength indicator box. This box dynamically changes color to indicate the strength of the generated password, providing visual feedback on whether the password is weak, moderate, or strong.

Furthermore, the application features a convenient "Copy" button that allows users to easily copy the generated password to their clipboard with a single click, ensuring a seamless user experience.

By checking or unchecking these options and utilizing the strength indicator and copy function, users can generate a password that meets their specific requirements for security and complexity. This project not only demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript and web development but also emphasizes the importance of password security in today's digital age.
